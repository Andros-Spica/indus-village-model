## 3.1 Base version (only elevation)

| input | output |
| :-: | :-: |
| parameters (14: Netlogo-style, 18: C#-style) | `elevation` |

The first step in setting elevation is to shape landforms. This step is split into two alternative algorithms, `set-landform-NetLogo` and `set-landform-Csharp`, which follows two different programming styles. The UI parameter `algorithm-style` controls which one is used. NetLogo-style relies more heavily on "patch" (i.e. grid cell) and turtle (i.e. agent) calls while C#-style was developed in C# and translated to NetLogo. Both alternatives sculpt discrete landform features by raising (ranges) or depressing (rifts) patch elevation and then smoothing them. The C# alternative includes an additional step that adds normal noise and then smooth elevation a second time. The C#-style algorithm is used by default.

The two following procedures bend the entire terrain towards specific general slopes. The procedure `set-xySlope` pushes all elevations to approximate the W-E (x) and N-S (y) inclination of a plane, balanced over the centre of the grid and reaching `riftHeight` (lower side) and `rangeHeight` (upper side). The degree in which the terrain adapts to this inclined plane is regulated by `xSlope` and `ySlope`. The procedure `set-valleySlope` forces the terrain towards a valley (`par_valleySlope > 0`) or a ridge (`par_valleySlope < 0`), which will generally have an N-S orientation (higher values of `par_valleyAxisInclination` will lean this valley towards the NE-SW diagonal). The high and low points of the valley or ridge aimed for also correspond to `riftHeight` and `rangeHeight`.

Example using a grid 50x50: 

| parameter | value |
| - | - |
| `algorithm-style` | "C#" | 
| `numRanges` | 1 |
| `numRifts` | 1 | 
| `rangeLength` | 5 |
| `riftLength` | 5 | 
| `rangeHeight` | 15 |
| `riftHeight` | -15 |
| `featureAngleRange` | 5 |
| `noise` | 1 | 
| `smoothStep` | 1 | 
| `smoothingRadius` | 0.1 | 
| `numProtuberances` | 1 | 
| `numDepressions` | 1 | 
| `rangeAggregation` | 0.75 | 
| `riftAggregation` | 0.9 | 
| `xSlope` | 0.01 | 
| `ySlope` | 0.025 | 
| `valleyAxisInclination` | 0.1 | 
| `valleySlope` | 0.02 |

## 3.2 Land model with flow directions

| input | output |
| :-: | :-: |
| parameters (18) | `elevation`, `flow_direction` |

In the next step, the so-called 'sinks' or inescapable depressions are filled following an algorithm based on:

> Huang P C and Lee K T (2015) A simple depression-filling method for raster and irregular elevation datasets, J. Earth Syst. Sci. 124 1653–65.

The `fill-sinks` procedure is optional and, if not applied, the terrain may have multiple closed basins.

Every patch is then assigned a `flowDirection` pointing towards the neighboring patch with the largest drop (least elevation accounting for horizontal distance). This variable is codified using the convention explained in:

> Jenson, S. K., & Domingue, J. O. (1988). Extracting topographic structure from digital elevation data for geographic information system analysis. Photogrammetric engineering and remote sensing, 54(11), 1593-1600.

which describes a `patch x y` neighbourhood as follows:

||*x-1*|*x*|*x+1*|
|-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|**_y+1_**| 64 | 128 | 1 |
|**_y_**| 32 | **centre** | 2 |
|**_y-1_**| 16 | 8 | 4 |

## 3.3 Land model with flow accumulation

| input | output |
| :-: | :-: |
| parameters (18+1) | `elevation`, `flow_direction`, `flow_accumulation` |

First, the lower patch at either the North or South edges (whichever has the highest average elevation) is selected as the patch with an entering river. This patch is assign a inward `flowDirection` and given a `flowAccumulation` value of `par_riverFlowAccumulationAtStart`. At some terrains, this will initiate a river flow that will cross the grid, generally downhill the XY and valley slopes.

The `set-flow-accumulations` procedure implements the algorithm described in Jenson and Domingue (1988), p. 1594:

> "FLOW ACCUMULATION DATA SET
> The third procedure of the conditioning phase makes use of the flow direction data set to create the flow accumulation data set, where each cell is assigned a value equal to the number of cells that flow to it (O’Callaghan and Mark, 1984). Cells having a flow accumulation value of zero (to which no other cells flow) generally correspond to the pattern of ridges. Because all cells in a depressionless DEM have a path to the data set edge, the pattern formed by highlighting cells with values higher than some threshold delineates a fully connected drainage network."

See [HTML with R walkthrough](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Andros-Spica/indus-village-model/blob/master/03-land-model/documentation/flowAccumulationOrder.html) explaining this algorithm.
