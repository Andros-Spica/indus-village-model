## 6.2 Food Storage with local exchange

In this version, the Food Storage model is complemented by an exchange mechanism that describes a common "market" that "buys" the surplus stock units released by households, stores them, and "sells" them back to households needing extra units to fulfil their desired diet. This "market" is called as such for the sake of implementation simplicity; it is actually more representative of a centralised redistribution institution because there is no accountability of value of stock units "bought" or "sold" by households and, thus, no stock unit price.
