The Soil Water (or Soil Water Balance) model represents the flow of water in a volume of soil on a daily basis. Water enters the system through precipitation or irrigation (potentially, also run-off of adjacent surface) and exits through transpiration, run-off, and deep drainage.

This model receives as input:  
* Daily precipitation (mm)
* Daily reference evapotranspiration (mm)
* Run-off curve number
* Other soil hydrologic properties:
    - Root zone depth (mm)
    - Water content at field capacity (%)
    - Water content at wilting point (%)
    - Water holding capacity (%)
    - Water uptake coefficient (%)
    - Drainage coefficient (%)

And returns as an output:
* Run-off water (mm) (transmitted to the next land unit in the flow)
* ARID coefficient (used in the Crop model and to modulate the biomass of non-crop ecological community)

This submodel is based on the original Soil Water Balance model from:

> Wallach D, Makowski D, Jones J W and Brun F (2014) _**Working with Dynamic Crop Models**_ (Second Edition) (Academic Press).  
> The Third Edition is available since 2019 but was not accessed (https://doi.org/10.1016/C2016-0-01552-8)  
> Model design is explained in pp. 24-28 and R code is presented in pp. 138-144. 

Their implementation in R (statistical software) can also be found as a package: https://github.com/cran/ZeBook/blob/master/R/watbal.model.r (their code does not include the calculation of the reference evapotranspiration).  

Example of the output:

This output uses data downloaded at NASAÂ´s POWER access viewer (https://power.larc.nasa.gov/data-access-viewer/) selecting the user community 'Agroclimatology' and pin-pointing the archaeological site of Rakhigarhi (Haryana, India; Lat 29.1687, Lon 76.0687) between 01/01/1990 and 31/12/2000. Rmarkdown and RStudio project source files are available at https://github.com/Andros-Spica/indus-village-model/tree/master/02-Soil-Water-Balance-model, including a copy of the source file with a few minor modifications (source/watbaLmodel.R) and an additional function for the calculation of the reference evapotranspiration (source/estimateETr.R).
