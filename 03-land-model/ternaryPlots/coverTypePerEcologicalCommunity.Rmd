Creating definitions for cover types according to proportions of grass, brush and wood, and building ternary plot.

Re-using code from: http://www.ggtern.com/2014/01/15/usda-textural-soil-classification/

Load the required libraries

```{r}
library(ggtern)
library(plyr)
library(grid)
```

Build data frame defining cover types using proportions of grass, brush, and wood. The criteria used for separating cover types (to select runoff curve number) was inferred from footnotes in:
>Table 2.2 in: Cronshey R G 1986 Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, Technical Release 55 (TR-55). United States Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, Engineering Division.

```{r}
coverTypes <- data.frame(
  rbind(
    # grass | brush | wood
    c(0,   0,   1,   "woodland"),
    c(0,   .5,  .5,  "woodland"),
    c(.4,  0,   .6,  "woodland"),
    c(1,   0,   0,   "grassland"),

```{r}
# Put tile labels at the midpoint of each tile.
