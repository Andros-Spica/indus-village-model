Requires the following R packages and the installation of Image Magick software (https://imagemagick.org/index.php).

```{r}
require(purrr)
require(magick)
```

Set up directory and new file names:

```{r}
filePath = "animation/"
fileName = "set-landform-animation"
```

Assuming all images are inside "animation" folder, get file names:

```{r}
files <- paste0(filePath, dir(path = filePath, 
                              pattern = paste0("^", fileName, ".*\\.png$")))
```

```{r}
images <- map(files, image_read)
images <- image_join(images)
animation <- image_animate(images, fps = 10)
image_write(animation, paste0(filePath, fileName, ".gif"))
```
