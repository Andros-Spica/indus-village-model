"""NOTES: categories can be breaked down into finer vegetation types as long as the model is able to operate with these values (e.g., evergreen and deciduous); biomass is here above ground biomass (AGB) and is only loosely controlled by source reference data, pending finding more general and systematic data; recovery lag is the number of days it takes for the vegetation component to grow from 0 to its local maximum; water stress sensitivity is the proportion of the vegetation component that is withered after a day under ARID=1 conditions; recovery lag and water stress sensitivity are preliminary approximations (no clear quantitative data identified yet)""",,,,,,,,,
