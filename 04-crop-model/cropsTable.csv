"""NOTES: S_CO2 is ignored in the adapted implementation of the SIMPLE crop model; 0 stands as missing values, except for variables in oC; from Table 1a in Zhao et al. 2019: 'T_sum=Cumulative temperature requirement from sowing to maturity (oC d). HI: Potential harvest index. I_50A: Cumulative temperature requirement for leaf area development to intercept 50% of radiation (oC d). I_50B: Cumulative temperature till maturity to reach 50% radiation interception due to leaf senescence (oC d). Tbase: Base temperature for phenology development and growth (oC). T_opt: Optimal temperature for biomass growth (oC). RUE: Radiation use efficiency (above ground only and without respiration) (g MJ?1 m-2). I_50maxH: The maximum daily reduction in I_50B due to heat stress (oC d). I_50maxW: The maximum daily reduction in I_50B due to drought stress (oC d). T_max: Threshold temperature to start accelerating senescence from heat stress (oC). T_ext: The extreme temperature threshold when RUE becomes 0 due to heat stress (oC). S_CO2: Relative increase in RUE per ppm elevated CO2 above 350 ppm. S_water: Sensitivity of RUE (or harvest index) to drought stress (ARID index).'; root zone depth is averaged from site data given in Zhao et al. 2019""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
